Welcome to TechTurtle's Thoughts blog!

I'm so excited to finally have this blog up. I've been wanting to start something like this for a while now 
so I could talk about projects I'm working on, post tutorials on random things I repeatedly need to look up, CTF writeups, 
talk about FAQs I get about cyber, and anything cyber-related, really. 

The truth is that I am really writing this for myself in order to develop my written communication skills better outside of research papers, but I hope
this helps someone else along the way. On that note, I can't promise that everything posted here will be 100% accurate, especially when it comes
to topics I am new to. After all, my goal is to learn and to share where I am at in my journey. That said, I will do the best of my ability to ensure 
that the information posted here is correct.
I welcome any feedback and am open for discussion if you find anything interesting or that needs to be corrected. 

If you feel compelled to do so for any reason, please don't hesitate to [reach out](/contact/).
