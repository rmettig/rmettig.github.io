I currently work with [Dr. Golden G. Richard III](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~golden/) at the LSU Applied Cybersecurity Lab, where a lot of the research is focused around memory forensics. 

My research interests lie in reverse engineering and binary analysis. Thus far, most of it has focused on malware analysis and on doing memory forensics with the [Volatility Framework](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation). 

For my master's thesis, I explored new forensic artifacts that are exclusive to Apple Silicon processors, some of which can only be recovered through memory analysis. 

During my undergraduate degree, I managed a repository of over 40 million malware samples and built automation mechanisms to help process them into a database that could later be used for research.
